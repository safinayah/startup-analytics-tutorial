## 📈 Core Business Metrics

### 1. **Customer Lifetime Value (LTV)**
**What it is:** The total revenue a customer generates over their entire relationship with your business.

**Why it matters:**
- 🎯 **Pricing Strategy:** Helps set optimal prices
- 💰 **Marketing Budget:** Determines how much you can spend to acquire customers
- 📊 **Business Valuation:** Key metric for investors

**Example Calculation (Realistic):**
- ARPU: $20.83/month
- Gross Margin: 80%
- Monthly Churn: 5.2%
- LTV = $20.83 × 0.80 × (1 ÷ 0.052) = $320
